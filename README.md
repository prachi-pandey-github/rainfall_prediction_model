Introduction
The project uses historical weather data to predict rainfall. Using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests, the model predicts whether there will be rainfall on a given day based on environmental factors. The notebook provides detailed steps from data loading to model evaluation, with the focus on building a robust model that can generalize well to new data.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are either imputed or removed.

Feature Selection: Relevant features like temperature, humidity, and pressure are selected for model training.

Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets.

Model Building
The notebook demonstrates the process of building and training machine learning models. Key steps include:

Feature Scaling: Features are scaled to ensure the model training process is efficient.

Model Selection: Various models, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests, are tested.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The model parameters are tuned to find the best configuration.

Model Evaluation
