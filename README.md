# Rainfall Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the rainfall in a given region using machine learning algorithms. The model leverages various features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure to make accurate predictions. The notebook provides an in-depth analysis of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, followed by evaluating the performance of the trained model.

## Introduction

The project uses historical weather data to predict rainfall. Using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests, the model predicts whether there will be rainfall on a given day based on environmental factors. The notebook provides detailed steps from data loading to model evaluation, with the focus on building a robust model that can generalize well to new data.
